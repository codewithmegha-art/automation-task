üîê Monitor Unencrypted S3 Buckets Using AWS Lambda and Boto3 

‚úÖ Objective
Automate detection of any S3 buckets without server-side encryption using AWS Lambda and Boto3. 

‚úÖ 1Ô∏è‚É£ S3 Setup
Created multiple S3 buckets.

Ensured some of them do not have server-side encryption enabled. 

 2Ô∏è‚É£ IAM Role Setup
Created a new IAM role for Lambda.

Attached the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy.

This allows listing buckets and reading their encryption configuration. 


‚úÖ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda Function Creation
Created a new AWS Lambda function:

Runtime: Python 3.x

IAM Role: The role created above

Configured basic settings (timeout, memory, environment) 


‚úÖ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda Function Code
Used Boto3 to:

List all S3 buckets

Attempt to get each bucket‚Äôs encryption configuration

Identify buckets without server-side encryption

Print unencrypted buckets in logs 


‚úÖ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Invocation and Testing
Manually invoked the Lambda function from AWS Console.

Checked logs in CloudWatch for output:

Listed unencrypted buckets successfully. 


‚úÖ Conclusion
‚úÖ Successfully detected S3 buckets without server-side encryption.
‚úÖ Verified output in Lambda logs.
‚úÖ Demonstrated AWS security posture monitoring using Boto3 and Lambda.
